[![Creating fully destructible cities while maintaining 60FPS](http://img.youtube.com/vi/mBJSeVKWPZ4/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBJSeVKWPZ4)

This is a simplified implementation of the link above using Godot, built as a proof of concept.
The main purpose is to make explosions (using the mouse) in certain locations of the buildings and with that causing the collapse of the building.

# TODO: Maybe someday

* [ ] Tweak `PinJoint3D`'s parameters for better building collapse (currently when it starts falling, the building floors start getting detached/in layers)
* [ ] Damage when collisions between blocks happen
* [ ] Damage when collisions between a block and the floor happens
* [ ] Sound effects when blocks collide with floor or each other
* [ ] Create more blocks for the Empire State building (mast/antenna on the top of the building)
* [ ] Make explosion VFX bigger/smaller/different depending on the `explosion_size_multiplier`
